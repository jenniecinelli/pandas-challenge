## Heroes of Pymoli
Analysis Report:

An analysis on a independent gaming companies data on their most recent fantasty game, Hereos of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. This report breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

According to the gender demographics analysis (table 3), people who identify as "male" are the leading group of players with a count of 484 or 84%.  However, in analyzing the purchasing analysis (table 4) in comparison to gender, people who have identified as "female" as well as "other/non-disclosed" have higher average purchase rates in comparison to people who have identified as "male". For example, "females" have an average purchase price of $3.20 and "other/non-disclosed" has an average purchase price of $3.35 where "males" have the lowest average purchase price of $3.02. In addition, "females" have an average total purchase price per person of $4.47 and "other/non-disclosed" has an average total purchase per person of $4.56 where "males" have an average of $4.07. As a result, it may be beneficial to push marketing efforts towards the groups of people who identify as "female" and "other/nondisclosed" to get more of this target demographic to purchase enhancment items as they spend on average more than people who identify as "male".

Based on the purchasing analysis in comparison to age (table 6), the largest number of item purchases come from the age group of 20-24, which is also the age group with the highest number count of players at a total count of 258 or 44.8% (table 5).  This age group has an average purchase price of $3.05 and an average total purchase per person of 4.32%. However, it appears that a few other age groups have a higher average purchase price and a higher average total purchase per person than the largest age demographic. For example, in table 6 the data reflects that the age group 35-39 has the highest average purchase price of $3.60 and the highest average total purchase per person at 4.76%. This result shows that it would be an advantageous to market these extra game items to persons who fall into this age demographic because the people that fall into this age group have proven that they are willing to spend on average more than any other age group on enhancement items as a whole as well as individually.

According to the most popular items analysis (table 8), Final Critic is the most popular item which is priced at $4.61. Oathbreaker is the second most popular item priced at $4.23. This is interesting as these products are not the highest priced items sold. According to table 9 whch compares the most profitable items, the item Nirvana is priced at $4.90 which is the third most profitable item sold following Final Critic (1) and Oathbreaker (2). Raising prices on Final Critic and Oathbreaker would be an option to take into consideration to increase revenue as they are the most popular (table 8) as well as the most profitable items (table 9).
